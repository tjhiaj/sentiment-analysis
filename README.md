# Sentiment Analysis

A sentiment calculator that leverages NLP. Applies Hugging Face Transformers and a BERT neural network.


## Features

- Displays the top 10 reviews of a restaurant and calculates their associated sentiments
- Sentiment scale from 1 (negative) to 5 (positive)
- Scrapes Yelp for restaurant reviews


## Tech Stack

**Language:** Python

**Frameworks:** Hugging Face Transformers, BERT, PyTorch, NumPy, Pandas

**Dev Tools:** BeautifulSoup, Requests, re


## How I Built It
First, I instantiate my model. AutoTokenizer is a class from Transformers that retrieves the relevant architecture based on the specified path to the pretrained model vocabulary. It creates a tokenizer that's an instance of the specified model tokenizer. Tokenizers convert strings into sequences of smaller elements called tokens (obvi) that are numerical representations the model can process. This is a crucial step in text preprocessing before passing data to an NLP model. In this case, the specified model is a version of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) that has been trained by NLP Town for sentiment analysis on multiple languages using uncased text. AutoModelForSequenceClassification is similar to AutoTokenizer except it creates a model instead of a tokenizer. The model has a sequence classification head, meaning it takes the output of a sequence model and transforms it into a probability distribution over the possible classes.

Next, I neeed to grab my webpage. I'm using the Yelp page of my favourite restaurant.

> Requests is a library that helps you send HTTP requests without having to manually add query strings or form-encode your data (convert to key-value pairs separated by '&' and assigned by '=') The request returns a response object (content, encoding, status, etc.)

Then, I create soup: a BeautifulSoup object. It stores the content of the page in a nested data structure and allows me to access tags and attributes of tags, as well as methods to search for these and navigate the tree-like structure. The purpose of this project is to analyse the sentiments of various comments left on the restaurant's page, so I create a regex that will help me find any class with the string "comment" in its name.

> re.compile() compiles the specified regex pattern into a regex object so it can be used for matching.

BeautifulSoup's find_all() method takes in the p tag (paragraphs) along with the class keyword to search for and return all matches to the class (via regex) within the paragraphs. This will be a list of objects, each consisting of the tag and found text. I then extract all the text components to form a list of reviews.

The next step is to create a data frame or table.
